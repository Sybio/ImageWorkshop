Documentation here : https://github.com/Sybio/ImageWorkshop/pull/37#issue-28704248

**Version 2.0.5 - 2013-11-12**

- Implementing interlace mode (http://php.net/manual/en/function.imageinterlace.php) on save() method to display progessive JPEG image

```php
    $interlace = true; // set true to enable interlace, false by default
    $layer->save($dirPath, $filename, $createFolders, $backgroundColor, $imageQuality, $interlace);
```

Thanks @dripolles (https://github.com/dripolles) & @johnhunt (https://github.com/johnhunt)

**Version 2.0.4 - 2013-09-11**

- Fix a major bug when resizing both sides AND conserving proportion : layer stack problem (current layer has a new 
nested level in its stack, not expected), and translations with positionX and positionY are wrong.
Fixed.
(Initial problem : https://github.com/Sybio/ImageWorkshop/pull/14)
- Add a parameter to clearStack() method

**Version 2.0.2 - 2013-06-14**

- Fix a new bug : when resizing or cropping, small images can have 0 pixel of width or height (because of round), which
is impossible and script crashes. Now width and height are 1 pixel minimum.

Note: 

```php
$layer->resizeInPixel(null, 0 /* or negative number */, null);
```

It will generate a 1 pixel height image, not 0.

**Version 2.0.1 - 2013-06-03**

- Fix an opacity bug : pure black color (#000000) always displayed fully transparent (from 0 to 99% opacity). Bug fixed ! (no known bug anymore)
- Add some Exceptions to help debugging

**Version 2.0.0 - 2012-11-21**

New version of ImageWorkshop ! The library is now divided in 3 main classes for cleaned code:
- ImageWorkshopLayer: the class which represents a layer, that you manipulate
- ImageWorkshop: a factory that is used to generate layers
- ImageWorkshopLib: a class containing some tools (for calculations, etc...), used by both classes

Technically, only the initialization change compared with the 1.3.x versions, check the documentation:
http://phpimageworkshop.com/documentation.html#chapter-initialization-of-a-layer

Here an example, before and now:
```php
    // before
    $layer = new ImageWorkshop(array(
        'imageFromPath' => '/path/to/images/picture.jpg',
    ));
```

```php
    // now
    $layer = ImageWorkshop::initFromPath('/path/to/images/picture.jpg');
```

And also the installation of the class: http://phpimageworkshop.com/installation.html

The documentation has been updated, you can now check the documentation of each version since 1.3.3:
(Ex: http://phpimageworkshop.com/doc/9/initialize-from-an-image-file.html?version=2.0.0, http://phpimageworkshop.com/doc/9/initialize-from-an-image-file.html?version=1.3.3)
